# CLI Commands Practice 🖥️

This repository contains my hands-on practice and notes while learning and working with **Command Line Interface (CLI)** commands on Linux.

## 📌 What I Practiced

Through this practice, I explored and understood the core concepts of working with the terminal, including:

### 🔐 Permissions & Ownership
- Understanding file permissions
- Modifying permissions using `chmod`
- Changing ownership using `chown`

### ⚙️ Processes & System Monitoring
- Viewing running processes using `ps`, `top`, `htop`
- Killing processes using `kill`

### 🌐 Networking & Ports

### 🔄 File Sync & Backup
- Synchronizing files using `rsync`

### 🔑 Git & SSH Basics
- Generating SSH keys
- Connecting local terminal to GitHub
- Understanding Git authentication

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal of this practice is to:
