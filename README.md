# Learning Skills

This repository is a personal learning journal where I document and practice concepts related to Linux and command-line usage.

The purpose of this repository is to keep clear notes from hands-on terminal practice and to build the habit of using Git and GitHub consistently.

The content is written based on direct experimentation in the terminal.
